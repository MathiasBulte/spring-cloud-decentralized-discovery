# Decentralized Discovery - WIP
Instead of using a centralized discovery server (for example, Eureka), discover other services through broadcasting on the network. 
# TODO
- Tests 
- Make UDP server ports configurable
- Integrate with Spring Cloud Gateway (just like Eureka integration works with it - but unfortunately Spring Cloud Gateway doesn't seem to support Spring Cloud LoadBalancer yet) 
- Adhere to Spring Boot Starter standards (starters end with -starter and depend on the actual implementations)
